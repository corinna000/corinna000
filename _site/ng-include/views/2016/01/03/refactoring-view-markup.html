    <p>We refactor our code to make it easier to reason about how the code works. When we find a bug we need to fix, or when there’s a new feature to add, it’s easier to do our work if we can make sense of what we’re seeing.</p>

<p>As we look at <a href="https://github.com/corinna000/refactoring-angular/tree/before_refactoring">SlamOff</a> before refactoring, we see that most of the application lives within <code>main.html</code> and <code>main.controller.js</code>. There are too many responsibilities crammed into too few units of work. We’re going to start by looking at <code>main.html</code> to work out its responsibilities, and then we’ll use <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngInclude">ng-include</a> to start creating fragments that are easier for us to reason about.</p>

<p><strong>The Refactoring Mantra</strong></p>

<pre><code>Refactoring is a disciplined habit of improving the internal structure of software to make it easier to reason about its operation. Refactoring is a practice of software development, not a goal unto itself.
</code></pre>

<p>Keeping our refactoring mantra in mind, let’s look at <code>main.html</code>. We know this view is doing a lot of different work. To help us start to reason about its responsibilities we’ll begin by moving fragments of HTML into separate files and then pulling them into the view using <code>ng-include</code>.</p>

<p>This is only a starting point to help us understand the responsibilities of our main view. After another pass of refactoring most of these fragments will probably be moved into separate components.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at <code>main.html</code> and identify some responsibilities</p>

<ul>
  <li>Search for poetry</li>
  <li>Display a list of search results</li>
  <li>Choose a subset of the search results for the SlamOff</li>
  <li>Display the poetry bracket</li>
  <li>Vote on each item of the poetry bracket</li>
  <li>Play a poem</li>
  <li>Display the track position of the playing poem</li>
  <li>Show the search results</li>
</ul>

<p>Whew! Those are a lot of responsibilities. Each one of those could be converted into a component. In fact, for the items that are repeated (the bracket sections, the play controls for each poems), converting those items to components would add reliability and reduce complexity of <code>main.html</code>.</p>

<p>There’s one more responsibility <code>main.html</code> has that isn’t in our list. Do you see it? It’s the responsibility of tying all our functionality together into the shell of the application. Even if we converted everything on our list into a component we’d still need a way to tie all of that functionality together.</p>

<h2 id="search-panel-fragment">search panel fragment</h2>

<p>Let’s begin by moving the search panel into a fragment. The search panel is helpfully contained within a div marked as a panel. We’ll move this entire div into its own file and then include it into <code>main.html</code>.</p>

<p><strong>app/search/search-fragment.html</strong></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="lineno"> 1</span> <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;panel panel-default&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 2</span>   <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;panel-body&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 3</span>     <span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;form-inline&quot;</span> <span class="na">ng-submit=</span><span class="s">&quot;vm.searchForPoetry()&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 4</span>       <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;form-group&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 5</span>         <span class="nt">&lt;label</span> <span class="na">for=</span><span class="s">&quot;poetrySearch&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Search for Slam Poetry<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 6</span>         <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;form-control&quot;</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;poetrySearch&quot;</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;poetrySearch&quot;</span> <span class="na">ng-model=</span><span class="s">&quot;vm.model.poetrySearch&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 7</span>         <span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;submit&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Search<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 8</span>       <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 9</span>     <span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno">10</span>   <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno">11</span> <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>To include the new fragment into <code>main.html</code> we’ll replace our old markup with the following code:</p>

<p><strong>app/main.html</strong></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="lineno">1</span> <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">ng-include=</span><span class="s">&quot;&#39;app/search/search-fragment.html&#39;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Note: The <code>ng-include</code> directive takes an expression as its value, therefore we need to add single quotes around the path to our fragment. This is easy to overlook, and you wouldn’t be the first person to make this mistake.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at our fragment, in particular the variables it uses from <code>MainController</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>vm.searchForPoetry()</li>
  <li>vm.model.poetrySearch</li>
</ul>

<p>We can start to make some inferences about a future search component. This component takes user input and searches SoundCloud for matches. Although not explictly shown in this fragment, the search will end with search results. We can see this in our next fragment:</p>

<p><strong>app/search/search-results-fragment.html</strong></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="lineno"> 1</span> <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;search-results&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 2</span>   <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">ng-show=</span><span class="s">&quot;!vm.selectedTracks.length&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 3</span>   <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">ng-show=</span><span class="s">&quot;vm.selectedTracks.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; vm.selectedTracks.length &lt; 8&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Select <span class="nt">&lt;span</span>
<span class="lineno"> 4</span>     <span class="na">ng-bind=</span><span class="s">&quot;8 - vm.selectedTracks.length&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span> more tracks<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 5</span>   <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">ng-show=</span><span class="s">&quot;vm.selectedTracks.length == 8&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="lineno"> 7</span>   <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 8</span>   <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">ng-show=</span><span class="s">&quot;vm.selectedTracks.length &gt; 8&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>You selected too many tracks!<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno"> 9</span>   <span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;checkedItems&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno">10</span>     <span class="nt">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno">11</span>       <span class="nt">&lt;li</span> <span class="na">ng-repeat=</span><span class="s">&quot;track in vm.searchResults track by $index&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno">12</span>         <span class="nt">&lt;label&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno">13</span>           <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;checkbox&quot;</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;track_&quot;</span> <span class="na">ng-model=</span><span class="s">&quot;track.selected&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno">14</span>            ()
<span class="lineno">15</span>         <span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno">16</span>       <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno">17</span>     <span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno">18</span>   <span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
<span class="lineno">19</span> <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>After moving html into a fragment, we’ll include it in <code>main.html</code>. We’ve reduced the markup in <code>main.html</code> by about thirty lines. It’s now a little easier to reason about the organization and responsibility of <code>main.html</code>. 
<strong>app/main.html</strong></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="lineno">1</span> <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">ng-include=</span><span class="s">&quot;&#39;app/search/search-results-fragment.html&#39;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
